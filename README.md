# HAMLdev

This is a small Ruby / Sinatra project to simplify website-development with HAML and SCSS.

## Install the gems

Run `gem install sinatra haml` to install the necessary gems.

## Run the server

To start the server, run `ruby server.rb` and [open your browser](http://127.0.0.1:4567/).

## Develop your website

Just put your HAML-templates in `/templates` and your SCSS-stylesheets in `/styles`. Now start being creative.
